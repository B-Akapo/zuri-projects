# Django
Django is one of the most popular(if not the most popular) open source high-level Python web framework. 

## Why Django
As a Developer Django is ver useful and a most learn because:
* **It is fast**. It takes applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible.
* **It is secure**. Django is probably the safest framework out there. It also helps developers avoid security mistakes.
* **It is scalable**. It is not harf to expand and extend apps built on Django.
* It handles most of the web development end, allowing you to focus on writing the app
